[*] Checking Version Usually Takes Some Time. And It Causes The Tool To Take Time To Get To The Main Menu.

[*] You Can Skip The Version Checking Part By Using '-f' in Last:
``` shell script
python e-tools.py -f
```
[*] If You Start The Tool With Above Command, The Tool Will Skip The Version Checking Process. Which Will Cause Tool To Start Faster.

[*] Skipping Version Checking Is Not Recommended. It May Cause To Lose New Version Update!!
